# ARDicee

ARDicee is an app that allows you to place AR dice on a flat plane from your real world surroundings and then "roll" them to get different numbers on each.

## Introduction

Pixel City is from a tutorial by Angelu Yu with the focus on working with ARKit, augmented reality, and 3D spaces and planes in general.

## Skills used

* ARKit
* Import rendered 3D model
* Edit 3D model
* 3D Planes/Nodes/Materials

## Process and challenges

ARDicee took the basics of an app from earlier in the course that allows you to roll 2D dice and get different results each time. Here, it was brought to 3D and augemented reality as well. It was interesting taking an existing conecpt I worked on applying a new focus to it. The 3D spaces were completely different and new. 

The process of how to create 3D objects was a bit complex at first, with nodes, materials, and everything needed. Once I found and imported a previously created 3D object (a die), I edited it by giving color to see more clearly. Then we added it to an array of dice objects to place on the 3D plane I created. I added a grid image to better see where each of the planes were beign created in AR.

Once all the dice properties were set and they could be placed properly within the plane, I added functions to allow them to rotate when either a button was tapped or the phone itself was shaken using a motion event.

## Reflection

There wasn't all that much code needed to create this app, but it was all completely new content that too awhile to sink in (especially 3D spaces for someone who doesn't like math).

But once it was working, I could see the fun potential that working with ARKit could provide in the future.
